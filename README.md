# Aviation Accident Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes NTSB aviation accident data to identify trends, assess fatality rates, and highlight safer aircraft models. The findings, presented in a stakeholder-focused Tableau dashboard, provide actionable insights for improving fleet safety, operational planning, and risk management.

Presentation of the project is uploaded in repository as presentation.pdf, non-technical slides demonstrating about the project analysis.

## Business Understanding
Aviation accidents can be costly in lives, money, and reputation. This project helps stakeholders see which aircraft models have better safety records and what factors drive higher risk. By turning raw NTSB accident data into clear, actionable insights, we aim to support smarter decisions that improve safety and reduce operational risk.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

Data Understanding:

We used NTSB accident data with details on aircraft models, dates, locations, and injury outcomes. 
Key features like total occupants, fatalities, and injury severity were selected for their direct link to safety. Missing values were cleaned for accurate analysis.

Data Analysis:

We examined accident trends, fatality rates, and high-risk factors across models and years. 
The results pinpoint safer aircraft types, riskier accident categories, and time periods with higher incident rates forming the basis for three safety-focused recommendations.

## Conclusion
The analysis of NTSB aviation accident data revealed clear differences in safety performance across aircraft models and accident types. By identifying lower-risk models, high-risk periods, and accident patterns, the project provides stakeholders with actionable insights to improve fleet selection, maintenance planning, and safety measures. The interactive Tableau dashboard offers a practical tool for ongoing data-driven decision-making in aviation safety.
